Programming Assignment #6 due 03/26/2018
Write an app to compute the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Your app should compute the
average for the previous business day closing time of the day you run the program and the time taken
for the computation. The component stocks which are included in the DJIA are decided by editorial
board of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). As of now, there are 30 company stocks and their symbols are:
"AXP", "AAPL", "BA", "CAT", "CVX", "CSCO", "KO", "DIS", "DWDP", "XOM", "GE", "GS", "HD", "IBM",
"INTC", "JNJ", "JPM", "MCD", "MRK", "MMM", "MSFT", "NKE", "PFE", "PG", "TRV", "UTX", "UNH", "VZ",
"V", "WMT".
DJIA is a very simple average calculated as the sum of the price of the 30 stock symbols divided by a
constant. The value of the constant (divisor) is decided by the WSJ board which changes from time to
time and as on now its value is 0.14523396877348. 
Your program must use a string url (uniform resource locator) to get the previous day stock price. For
example, the URL
https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/AAPLinterval=2m
will download the price of AAPL symbol as a String. You need to download and retrieve the prices as a
background thread using a class that extends the AsyncTask class. You need a progress bar which
displays the progress of the computation (need to have 30 stick increments). The progress bar must
appear only when the computation begins and disappear when the computation ends. The initial display
should be as shown in Figure 1. When the COMPUTE button is clicked, the progress bar appears, shows
30 progress ticks, and disappear as soon as the average is displayed. A sample display while the
computation is in progress is given in Figure 2. When the computation is complete, you need to display
the average and the time taken for the computation rounded to two decimal precision with comma
separation as needed. A sample display is given in Figure 3. The figures displayed use an AVD for Nexus 6
having API 26. If you work on the project from your home computer, you need to run the app on a lab
computer before submitting using git. If I cannot open and run the app you pushed into the git
repository, your assignment may not get graded.
Project Requirement: (1) Your app project folder must be named as Lab6. (2) Your output for DJIA must
use comma separation and rounded to two decimal precision, and time taken in seconds rounded to
two decimal precision. (3) Your display must contain all the features as shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3. The
activity Java class must have as comments your name, a short description, and what you learned in one
or two sentences from the lab assignment.
Steps to turning in your assignment:
(1) Copy the app folder Lab6 into the ~/Documents/cs3303/gitRep/XX99999 directory, where
XX999999 is your user_id.
(2) cd into XX99999 directory and enter the command git add Lab6
(3) enter the command git commit –m “My lab 6 work mm/dd/yy”
(4) enter the command git push origin master
